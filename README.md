# CS305SoftwareSecurity

# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
As a financial consulting firm, Artemis Financial aims to modernize its business procedures through the development of a web application. To accomplish this task, they hired Global Rain, a company known for prioritizing data flow verification, to create an application that allows users to submit files and access accounts. 

# What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
This project boasted the ability to generate checksum values using various encryption methods, ensuring data validation independent of the security protocol employed. In today's digital landscape, security is paramount, regardless of the size of the application. Safeguarding customer and company data throughout the software development life cycle is crucial, especially considering the increasing prevalence of cyberattacks and software piracy.

# What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
During the course of this project, I encountered challenges while reviewing the vulnerability report generated by Maven dependency checks. Many of the facts presented were unfamiliar to me, but I recognized the importance of running dependency checks, particularly for applications heavily reliant on frameworks and external APIs for data manipulation and collection.

# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
To enhance the application's security, I implemented a multi-layered encryption and security strategy, utilizing various encryption methods based on the specific requirements of each application component. Some methods were more suitable for validating file information, while others focused on user credential authentication.

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Before integrating internal and external resources, I conducted functional evaluations of each web application component independently. This allowed me to ensure the proper integration of resources and minimized the introduction of additional vulnerabilities. Running vulnerability checks after making code modifications provided an extra layer of assurance.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Throughout the development process, the Spring framework documentation and instructions on generating and interpreting vulnerability reports played a critical role. Familiarizing myself with the documentation for specific tools and programming languages proved invaluable, especially when working with new technologies.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would like to highlight the significance of vulnerability reports and the effort I put into understanding and analyzing their findings. I acknowledge that interpreting these reports may still be a challenge, but I believe that my dedication to this task has deepened my understanding and prepared me for future endeavors.
